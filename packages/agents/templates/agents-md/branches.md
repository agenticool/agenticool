## Branch names

Every branch an agent pushes for an issue is named `agent/<issue>-<slug>`. When one leaf is split into stacked layers, layers after the first end in `-part-<n>`. A branch stacked on another issue's PR uses its own issue's name:

- `<issue>` is the number of the leaf issue the PR closes, without `#`.
- `<slug>` is that issue's title in lowercase, with accents dropped and every run of other characters turned into `-`. "Part N" in the title becomes `partN`. The slug is cut to 40 characters at a word boundary, and is `issue` when the title has no ASCII letters or digits.
- Examples: `agent/5-generate-and-enforce-branch-names-from` for #5, and `agent/5-generate-and-enforce-branch-names-from-part-2` for its second stacked layer.

For issue work, never type a branch name by hand. Print it with `npx agenticool-dispatch branch-name <issue>`, adding `--layer <n>` for layer 2 and up. Create the branch with that name, or run `git branch -m <name>` when your tool created the worktree branch under another name. Do this before the first commit. Once a branch is pushed, keep its name, even if the issue title changes later. Nothing in CI checks branch names, so following this rule is up to you.
